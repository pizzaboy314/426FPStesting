Player is the Character Controller. It has a Camera object at head height that provides the FPS view throughout the game.
You'll notice there's a script attached, which has all the scripting for the player. Under said script, you can 
adjust the global variables in the script. 

MovementSpeed		// how fast you can move around
SprintMultiplier	// what factor to multiply your movement speed times for sprinting
MouseSensitivity	// the speed at which your mouse movement affects your viewpoint
UpDownRange			// the angle you want to limit your upwards and downwards viewpoint (IE you can't look directly down or directly up)
JumpSpeed			// how high your jump is
