>importing
1. Drag and drop like usual, u probably want to group select the texture images here too
2. then u clcik the model u dragged in (in the Assets or whatever folder)
3. set "animation type" to humanoid and apply
4. Then to the animations tab
5. You need to select each "clip" and mark checkbox "loop"
6. Also go to "Model" tab and set scale factor to 1
otherwise when u put the model into teh scene it'll be too
small
NOTE: the factor affect models already dropped into the scene also

>attach animation to model
6. drag and drop the model into the scene
7. click the drop down on the model in the assets fold (not the hierachy tab)
8. select the animations ("idle", "walk","run") and drag onto the model in
the scene (or into the heiarchy)
9. click the model in the scene and double clcik the controller (mine is named
"leslie" just like the model). This shoudl open ouht the "Animator" tab
NOTE: Orange means default action, shows be running when u drag the model into the scene


NOTE2: If there another model with a humanoid rig, u can take these animation and do the same
with them (i belive, from what i've tried)
BUT THEY MUST HAVE THE SAME MODEL ORIENTATION (T-POSE)
otherwise when u give the other model this one's animation, it'll be off

>tweaking (in animator controller)
1. right click, Make transition, left click where to (eg idle to walk AND  vice versa and etc.)
2. create a new Parameter (the plus symbol bot right next to "Parameter") 
(speed float, isWalking bool, whatever you want) u modify these in scrpit
3. click on the white transition arrow that you've made (scrolling down is the Inspector)
and change Exit Time with whatever u made in step 2 and change the conditions
4. tweak the (blue) arrows above a timeline (just above the "Conditions" section) to
 make the transition smoother (the preview shows the transition)
4. change exit time to whatever u made in step 2
